/**
* \ingroup onoff
*
* \brief Generate traffic to a single destination according to an
*        OnOff pattern.
*
* This traffic generator follows an On/Off pattern: after
* Application::StartApplication
* is called, "On" and "Off" states alternate. The duration of each of
* these states is determined with the onTime and the offTime random
* variables. During the "Off" state, no traffic is generated.
* During the "On" state, cbr traffic is generated. This cbr traffic is
* characterized by the specified "data rate" and "packet size".
*
* Note:  When an application is started, the first packet transmission
* occurs _after_ a delay equal to (packet size/bit rate).  Note also,
* when an application transitions into an off state in between packet
* transmissions, the remaining time until when the next transmission
* would have occurred is cached and is used when the application starts
* up again.  Example:  packet size = 1000 bits, bit rate = 500 bits/sec.
* If the application is started at time 3 seconds, the first packet
* transmission will be scheduled for time 5 seconds (3 + 1000/500)
* and subsequent transmissions at 2 second intervals.  If the above
* application were instead stopped at time 4 seconds, and restarted at
* time 5.5 seconds, then the first packet would be sent at time 6.5 seconds,
* because when it was stopped at 4 seconds, there was only 1 second remaining
* until the originally scheduled transmission, and this time remaining
* information is cached and used to schedule the next transmission
* upon restarting.
*
* If the underlying socket type supports broadcast, this application
* will automatically enable the SetAllowBroadcast(true) socket option.
